# Systematic comparison of multi-omics survival models reveals a widespread lack of noise resistance

## Abstract

With decreasing costs of high-throughput sequencing, more and more studies have started to provide multi-omics molecular profiles of patients with cancer. This has led to various developments of novel survival analysis approaches integrating these heterogeneous molecular and clinical groups of variables. Although some of these methods have reached state-of-the-art results in cancer survival prediction, many have demonstrated a decay in performance when integrating larger numbers of omics modalities. As observed in several previous studies, integrating more molecular modalities in multi-omics cancer survival models may not always improve model accuracy. In this study, we compared eight deep learning and four statistical integration techniques for survival prediction on 17 multi-omics datasets, examining model performance in terms of overall accuracy and noise resistance. We found that one deep learning method, mean late fusion, and two statistical methods, PriorityLasso and BlockForest, performed best in terms of both noise resistance and overall discriminative and calibration performance. Nevertheless, all methods struggled to adequately handle noise when too many modalities were added. In summary, we confirmed that current multi-omics survival methods are not sufficiently noise resistant. We recommend relying on only modalities for which there is known predictive value for a particular cancer type until models that have stronger noise resistance properties are developed.

## Reproducibility

### From scratch

Since installing via conda and R in bash scripts can be finicky and anyway requires user input, we guide you through the process below, after which you may reproduce all of our results by executing our reproduction script.

#### Python

Please run the following in a terminal and give user input as appropriate (e.g., confirming that you want to create a new conda env).

```sh
conda create -n noise_resistance python==3.10.0
conda activate noise_resistance
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

#### R

We require you to have R 4.1.3 installed - we recommend to use [Rig](https://github.com/r-lib/rig) to manage different R versions.

Supposing you already have R 4.1.3, you may simply run the below in a terminal.

```sh
Rscript -e "install.packages('renv');require(renv);renv::activate();renv::restore()"
```

#### Running experiments

Once both the necessary R and Python packages are installed, you may reproduce all of our work (including data downloads, preprocessing, etc) by running the below in a terminal (make sure to activate the respective conda environment if it is not already active).

```sh
bash reproduce.sh
```

### Results

All of our results, including preprocessed data, computed performance metrics and predicted survival functions for all models and experiments are available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/7529459).

## Caveats

### Speed

Please note that none of the models here (in particular the methods in torch) have been optimised for minimising computation times, so if computation times are important to you, we advise you to reimplement them (especially the Cox loss, following a strategy similar to [1]).

### Code clarity

Please note that several parts of the code could be made clearer through refactoring - we have left them in their original state in order to ensure reproducibility. In case anything is unclear, please reach out.
